# html-css-sample
This project demonstrates my ability to structure and style a simple webpage using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.   It was created as part of a portfolio submission to showcase clean, semantic code and modern styling practices.

## Project Overview
The sample webpage includes:
- A responsive layout using semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- A simple navigation bar and content section
- Basic CSS styling for typography, colors, and spacing
- A sample card component with an image, title, and button

## Technology Used
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
