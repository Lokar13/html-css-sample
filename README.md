# html-css-sample
This project demonstrates my ability to structure and style a simple multi-page webpage using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
It was created as part of a portfolio submission to showcase clean, semantic code, responsive layout design, and modern visual styling practices.


## Project Overview
The sample webpage includes:

- A responsive layout using semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- A simple navigation bar linking to **Projects** and **Contact** pages
- A profile image component with clean styling and shadow effects
- Basic CSS styling for typography, colors, spacing, and hover effects
- A sample card layout showcasing structured content presentation

## Technology Used
- **HTML5** â€” for semantic and accessible structure  
- **CSS3** â€” for responsive and modern design  
- **GitHub Pages** â€” for hosting and live preview
